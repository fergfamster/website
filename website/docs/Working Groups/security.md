# Security Working Group

**Mission**: To provide security primitives, objectives, controls and implementation guidance to ensure proper
understanding for the field in deploying agentic workflows.

**Problem Statement**: Agentic Security primitives have been widely defined across sectors. However given the nascent
relationship to identity, threat intelligence, proactive security measures, compliance and governance controls, we need
to navigate a set of known and unknown outcomes and processes by which companies can be secure while ensuring
operational readiness and compliance.

**Goals & Success**:

[Primary Goal] - Create a reference matrix and foundational principles for enabling security and production ready
agentic systems.

[Secondary Goal] - Create a tool that helps define threat modeling, Pen testing and operational controls for compliance
and audibility

[Third Goal] - Support other community teams in their goals of defining security in each lane

# **Purpose**

This framework defines identity-centric controls for Gen AI agents, mapping security requirements to each agent component and to end-to-end flows. It emphasizes Zero Trust, least privilege, short-lived credentials, privacy-by-design, and continuous monitoring to reduce risks like impersonation, data exfiltration, and abuse.


# **Core Principles**

1.** Zero Trust by Default**

Every interaction—between users, systems, and services—must be verified. Nothing is trusted automatically, even within the same network. Each step of communication (human ↔ app, app ↔ backend, agent ↔ tools/data) requires authentication and authorization.

**2. Least Privilege Access**

Users and agents get only the permissions needed for their tasks. Access is denied by default and granted only for specific, approved purposes. This reduces damage if credentials are compromised.

**3. Short-Lived Credentials**

Use temporary credentials that expire quickly and rotate often. This limits exposure if tokens or keys are leaked. Example: short-lived OAuth or mTLS tokens that auto-renew securely.

**4. Strong and Verifiable Identity**

Every user, service, and AI agent must have a unique, verifiable identity. Service identities should be cryptographically verifiable using systems like SPIFFE/SPIRE or signed tokens, ensuring authenticity and preventing spoofing.

**5. Separation of Duties**

Separate who decides access (Policy Decision Point) from who enforces it (Policy Enforcement Point). Keep secrets and runtime environments isolated to avoid privilege overlap or misuse.

**6. Comprehensive Auditability**

All identity-related actions must be logged securely and made tamper-evident. These logs should provide a clear picture of who did what, when, and why—enabling accountability and quick detection of anomalies.

**7. Privacy and Safety by Design**

Protect personal and sensitive data through redaction, minimization, and encryption. Ensure AI prompts and data flows adhere to privacy and ethical guidelines, including guardrails to prevent data leaks or unsafe outputs.

**Additional Identity Security Principles**

**8. Context-Aware Access**

Access should adapt to context—such as device posture, user location, time, or behavior. For example, deny access from unknown devices or unusual networks even if credentials are valid.

**9. Purpose-Based Data Usage**

Data access should always align with the intended, approved purpose. AI agents and users must declare their purpose before accessing data, and policies must enforce that declared purpose.

**10. Delegated and Impersonated Access with Consent**

When an AI agent acts on behalf of a human, it must first obtain explicit, time-bound consent. All impersonated actions must be visible to the human and fully auditable.

**11. Continuous Identity Assurance**

Identity verification shouldn’t stop after login. Systems should revalidate user and agent behavior throughout sessions—detecting anomalies like sudden location changes or abnormal activity.

**12. Defense in Depth**

Layer multiple controls—authentication, authorization, encryption, monitoring—so a single failure doesn’t lead to compromise. Each layer independently protects against misuse or breach.

**13. Resilience and Revocation**

Enable quick revocation of credentials, sessions, or impersonation rights if a threat is detected. Ensure systems recover gracefully and securely after compromise.

# **Identity-Critical Flows**


## **• End-User Login → IdP (OIDC/OAuth 2.1 + MFA/WebAuthn) → token issued → FE stores HttpOnly cookie → API GW validates.**

• Request Execution → FE→Gateway (PEP)→Orchestrator→Agent Components (mTLS/JWT)→Tools/Data (scoped, short-lived creds).

• On-Behalf-Of → Step-up MFA/consent → delegated token (RFC 8693) → auto-expire ≤30m → full audit trail.

• Memory Access → PEP→PDP purpose check → masked read/write → DLP post-check and lineage tags.


# **Extended Security Requirements**


## **Contextual Resource Access**

Contextual access control enforces security by validating context signals such as user location, device posture, network zone, and time of access. These signals determine whether access should be granted or restricted. This ensures higher security for sensitive operations by dynamically adjusting controls.

Example: A Gen AI agent denies access to sensitive training data if the request originates from an unmanaged device.


## **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

ABAC policies leverage attributes of users, resources, and the environment to make fine-grained access decisions. Attributes can include role, clearance level, resource classification, or session risk score.

Example: A user with the attribute 'role=data_scientist' and clearance 'PII-read' may access anonymized datasets but not raw PII.


## **Purpose-Based Access Control (PBAC)**

Purpose-based access ensures that data or resources are accessed only when the purpose aligns with policy-approved activities. Every request is tagged with a declared purpose, and policies validate alignment before granting access.

Example: An AI agent can access patient data for 'treatment' purposes but is denied when the declared purpose is 'marketing'.


## **Resource-Bound Access Tokens (RBT)**

Resource-bound access tokens are cryptographically bound to a specific resource or context, preventing token misuse across other systems. They ensure that even if a token is stolen, it cannot be replayed against unauthorized resources.

Example: A short-lived JWT bound to a specific RAG collection cannot be reused to query unrelated datasets.


# **Appendix A – Examples of Advanced Security Controls**

• Contextual Access: Deny cross-border access attempts to sensitive datasets outside approved geographies.

• ABAC: Allow only agents tagged with 'confidential-project=true' to access internal research repositories.

• PBAC: Enforce purpose tags in API calls; reject access if the declared purpose does not match approved use cases.

• RBT: Issue resource-scoped tokens for each microservice call; reject replayed tokens at unrelated services.


# **Identity Security for Human Impersonation by Gen AI Agents**

Human impersonation by Gen AI agents introduces unique security risks. When agents act on behalf of a human, the system must enforce strict identity assurance, explicit consent, and auditable boundaries. These requirements prevent misuse of impersonation capabilities while preserving legitimate use cases such as delegated task execution.


## **Security Principles**

• Explicit Consent: Humans must grant informed, time-bound consent before impersonation begins.

• Least Privilege: Impersonated sessions inherit only the minimum privileges required for the delegated task.

• Transparency: All impersonated actions must be clearly visible to the human and logged for audit.

• Revocability: Humans must have the ability to revoke impersonation rights at any time.

• Accountability: Immutable logs and alerts ensure traceability of impersonated actions.


## **Security Requirements**

• Authentication (AuthN): Require strong step-up authentication (e.g., MFA/WebAuthn) before an agent begins impersonation.

• Authorization (AuthZ): Scope impersonation tokens narrowly, limiting them to predefined tasks or resources.

• Defaults: Impersonation sessions auto-expire within short time windows (e.g., ≤30 minutes).

• Guardrails: Notify the human of each impersonated action in real time and maintain detailed audit logs.

• Standards: Align impersonation flows with OAuth 2.1 'on-behalf-of' grants (RFC 8693) and NIST 800-63 digital identity assurance levels.


# **Appendix B – Examples of Human Impersonation Controls**

• An AI assistant impersonates a support agent to reset a customer password, but only after the human approves via MFA.

• An agent impersonates a project manager to schedule meetings, but cannot access the manager’s financial approvals.

• Each impersonated action (e.g., sending an email) triggers a notification to the human for transparency.

• Impersonation tokens expire after 20 minutes, requiring renewal with explicit human consent.


# **Practical Example – End-to-End Implementation**

1) Login & Context: The support agent signs in via OIDC/OAuth 2.1 with WebAuthn (MFA). Frontend captures context (managed device, corp network) and risk score.

2) Token Validation & PEP: API Gateway validates iss/aud/exp and enforces rate/quota, schema checks, and CSRF/CORS protections.

3) Purpose & Policy: The request is tagged purpose=customer_support_refund. Orchestrator calls PDP, which evaluates ABAC (role=csr, region allowed), PBAC (purpose matches policy), and contextual rules (device posture).

4) Scoped Credentials: Tools Adapter requests a short-lived Resource-Bound Token (RBT) from KMS/Data Broker scoped to orders:read and orders:refund for collection=orders_eu only.

5) Retrieval with Minimization: RAG fetch narrows to necessary fields (order_id, status, amount) with row/column ACL; guardrails scan retrieved chunks (DLP).

6) Human Impersonation: For email send as the human agent, system prompts step-up MFA and explicit consent; issues on-behalf-of token limited to send_email:refund_ack for 20 minutes.

7) Execution & Guardrails: Reasoner prepares refund; Guardrails check for policy/prompt violations; Orchestrator executes tool call using RBT; email sent with impersonation token.

8) Audit & Alerts: Observability records who/what/when/why (purpose, scopes, token IDs). Anomaly detection monitors unusual access or refund volumes.


## **Requirement Mapping**

• Contextual Resource Access → Steps 1 & 3 (device posture, network zone, risk).

• ABAC → Step 3 (role=csr, region=EU applied at PDP).

• Purpose-Based Access Control → Steps 3 & 8 (purpose=customer_support_refund).

• Resource-Bound Access Tokens → Step 4 (RBT scoped to orders_eu with orders:refund).

• Human Impersonation Controls → Step 6 (MFA, consent, OBO token with 20m TTL).

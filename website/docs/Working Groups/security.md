# Security Working Group

**Mission**: To provide security primitives, objectives, controls and implementation guidance to ensure proper
understanding for the field in deploying agentic workflows.

**Problem Statement**: Agentic Security primitives have been widely defined across sectors. However given the nascent
relationship to identity, threat intelligence, proactive security measures, compliance and governance controls, we need
to navigate a set of known and unknown outcomes and processes by which companies can be secure while ensuring
operational readiness and compliance.

**Goals & Success**:

[Primary Goal] - Create a reference matrix and foundational principles for enabling security and production ready
agentic systems.

[Secondary Goal] - Create a tool that helps define threat modeling, Pen testing and operational controls for compliance
and audibility

[Third Goal] - Support other community teams in their goals of defining security in each lane

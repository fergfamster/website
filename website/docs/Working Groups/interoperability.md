# Interoperability Working Group

**Mission**: To establish effective agent-to-agent communication patterns by evaluating and implementing standard
protocols for enterprise-grade agentic systems.

**Problem We Are Trying To Solve**: As agentic AI systems grow in complexity, effective communication between agents
across different subsystems becomes crucial. Organizations face challenges in implementing standardized agent-to-agent
interactions, including:

- Choosing appropriate communication protocols and architectures
- Implement inter-agent messaging (direct messaging, broadcasting, API and standard protocol based interaction)
- Implementing security measures and guardrails
- Optimizing for latency, scalability, and performance
- Integrating components like Agent Gateways and Mesh systems to facilitate session fan-out, bidirectional SSE, protocol
  negotiation or per-agent tenancy

There's a need for practical guidance on implementing these systems effectively in enterprise environments, considering
various protocols and architectural patterns.

**Purpose**: The working group is dedicated to developing and promoting open standards for effective communication and
interaction between AI agents and systems. This initiative encompasses areas and industry standards such as
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol for seamless inter-agent communication, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool
access, and unified agent communication mechanisms and messaging formats. By collaboratively establishing these
standards and providing reference architectures, the community aims to create a robust foundation for interoperable AI
systems.

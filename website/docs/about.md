# Introducing the Agentic Community
## Vision

To create a community around AI agents, accessible to all, developed collaboratively, and deployed efficiently to solve complex challenges at scale.

## Mission

The Agentic Community unites companies, developers, researchers, and practitioners in an open ecosystem to advance the state of agentic systems. We commit to:
- Cultivate open source frameworks, standards, and best practices that enable interoperability across agentic systems
- Foster inclusive collaboration between industry, academia, independent developers, and end-users
- Accelerate innovation through shared research, benchmarks, and technical resources
- Ensure agentic technologies evolve in alignment with human values, safety, and ethical principles
- Democratize access to agent technologies, making them available to all regardless of organizational size or resources
- Create educational pathways and professional development opportunities in the agent ecosystem
- Advocate for responsible governance and technological approaches that maximize societal benefit

## Values
**Openness**: We believe in transparent development processes, open standards, and freely accessible knowledge that enables widespread participation.

**Collaboration**: We value diverse perspectives and collective problem-solving over siloed development, recognizing that the most robust solutions emerge from community effort.

**Inclusivity**: We actively work to ensure our community welcomes participants of all backgrounds, experience levels, and organizational affiliations.

**Innovation**: We embrace experimentation, creative approaches, and breakthrough thinking to advance the field of agentic systems.

**Responsibility**: We prioritize the ethical implications of our work, considering safety, security, privacy, and the societal impact of autonomous agents.

**Interoperability**: We champion solutions that work together across platforms, creating a connected ecosystem rather than isolated tools.

**Human-Centered Design**: We develop agent technologies that amplify human capabilities, align with human needs, and remain under meaningful human control.

**Sustainability**: We build for long-term impact, maintaining stewardship of projects and ensuring the viability of our community for years to come.

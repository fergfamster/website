We commit to:  Cultivate open source frameworks, standards, and best practices that enable interoperability across agentic systemsFoster inclusive collaboration between industry, academia, independent developers, and end-usersAccelerate innovation through shared research, benchmarks, and technical resourcesEnsure agentic technologies evolve in alignment with human values, safety, and ethical principlesDemocratize access to agent technologies, making them available to all regardless of organizational size or resourcesCreate educational pathways and professional development opportunities in the agent ecosystemAdvocate for responsible governance and technological approaches that maximize societal benefit  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Values​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Introducing the Agentic Community","url":"/docs/about#values","content":" Openness: We believe in transparent development processes, open standards, and freely accessible knowledge that enables widespread participation.  Collaboration: We value diverse perspectives and collective problem-solving over siloed development, recognizing that the most robust solutions emerge from community effort.  Inclusivity: We actively work to ensure our community welcomes participants of all backgrounds, experience levels, and organizational affiliations.  Innovation: We embrace experimentation, creative approaches, and breakthrough thinking to advance the field of agentic systems.  Responsibility: We prioritize the ethical implications of our work, considering safety, security, privacy, and the societal impact of autonomous agents.  Interoperability: We champion solutions that work together across platforms, creating a connected ecosystem rather than isolated tools.  Human-Centered Design: We develop agent technologies that amplify human capabilities, align with human needs, and remain under meaningful human control.  Sustainability: We build for long-term impact, maintaining stewardship of projects and ensuring the viability of our community for years to come.
